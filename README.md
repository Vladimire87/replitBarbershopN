# Sinatra

Sinatra is a domain-specific language for building web applications in Ruby. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, and is an alternative to more full-featured web application frameworks such as Ruby on Rails. Sinatra allows you to build web applications quickly, with minimal code and configuration, and is well-suited for building simple, single-page applications or for prototyping. It uses a routing system to map URLs to code, and makes it easy to define actions that are triggered by specific HTTP verbs (such as GET, POST, and DELETE).

One of the key features of Sinatra is its flexibility. Because it is a domain-specific language, Sinatra allows you to write code in a way that is more concise and expressive than you would be able to with a more general-purpose language like Ruby. This makes it easier to build web applications quickly, and allows you to focus on the specific requirements of your application rather than the underlying framework.

Some of the key features of Sinatra include are:

- Lightweight and easy to use
- Flexible and expressive
- Powerful routing system
- Supports multiple template engines
- Extensible
